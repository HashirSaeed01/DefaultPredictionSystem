Loan Default Prediction System â€“ Final Year Project
A full-stack MLOps pipeline designed to predict corporate loan defaults using financial data. The system ingests structured financial inputs, applies preprocessing and feature engineering, and feeds the data into multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

The backend is served via Flask, containerized with Docker, and connected to a PostgreSQL database. Predictions are stored and retrieved through the API. The entire ETL and ML lifecycle is designed with MLOps principles, including model versioning and reproducibility.
